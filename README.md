# Approach

Energy transition will mean certain communities will have their historical livelihood altered (eg - coal mining towns). Throwing a bunch of a renewable generation in their region might help, but it's likely not going to be enough (and there's also the problems that come with can we even handle all those extra renewables out in that area). Colocating H2 generation has been one idea floated but there might not be a large enough H2 economy to do this at scale. What if instead we investigated colocating other high energy processes? Eg - green steel/aluminum or fertilizer production?
