* Australia third largest wheat exporter
	* 2005 grain emissions were 13.75 Million Tons of CO2
		* 61% Are on farm (eg - fertilizer use, breakdown of plant residue )
		* 39% are embedded (eg - fertilizer production)
		* The on farm emissions are 1.7% of Australia's total 

# Possible Issues

Nitrogen pollution is a very real risk

Can these plants even be built in a way that isn't destructive?

Ammonia shipping is a little nasty


# Haber-Bosch Process

* Generates ammonia/nitrates
* Air + Iron Oxide (catalyst) + H2 + Lots of energy
* Can operate continuously or in shorter bursts
	* Requires a reaction chamber at around 500C
	* Requires pressure (normally)
* Iron Oxide requirements aren't massive

# Transport

Need to generate, but also need to export. Port infrastructure for pulling coal might be able to play a role.
